"""
The patient visits three days in a row and the doctor discovers that on the
first day he feels normal, on the second day he feels cold, on the third day
he feels dizzy. The doctor has a question: what is the most likely sequence of
health conditions of the patient that would explain these observations?
This is answered by the Viterbi algorithm.
